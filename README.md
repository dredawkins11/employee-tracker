This is my Module 12 challenge that I have completed.

The task for this challenge was to create a CLI program that would be able to keep track of a companies employees. This included creating departments, roles, and employees. This also included having employees assigned to roles, and roles assigned to employees. The CLI needed to also be capable of updating employees and displaying all of this data.
